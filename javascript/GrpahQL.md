## Some of GraphQL features include:       

- Hierarchical - Queries look exactly like the data they return.      
- Client-specified queries - The client has the liberty to dictate what to fetch from the server.     
- Strongly typed - You can validate a query syntactically and within the GraphQL type system before execution. This also helps leverage powerful tools that improve the development experience, such as GraphiQL.     
- Introspective - You can query the type system using the GraphQL syntax itself. This is great for parsing incoming data into strongly-typed interfaces, and not having to deal with parsing and manually transforming JSON into objects.     

## Schema       
Schema defines Class type, Query method signature, Mutation method signature.       

## Resolvers        
Resolvers define the relationship between schema and method implementation.     

Method body can be defined in server.js
