## Form 1098-T  
https://www.baylor.edu/sfs/index.php?id=936966

With a 1098-T, the business — your college — reports how much qualified tuition and expenses you (or your parents) paid it 
during the tax year. The IRS uses these forms to match data from information returns to income, deductions and credits 
reported on individual income tax returns.Dec 4, 2019   

No, you don't have to report your 1098-T, not unless you want to claim an education credit. However if your 
grant/scholarship amount (box 5) is more than your tuition (box 1/box 2) you may want to report it because 
excess scholarship money may be treated as taxable income on your return.

## Form 8843    
https://www.baylor.edu/globalengagement/index.php?id=962297     

All individuals in F-1, F-2, J-1, or J-2 nonimmigrant status must file Form 8843 also called the “Statement for 
Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition" even if they received NO income during the past 
year and regardless of their age. You may have to file Form 8843 and an Income Tax Return as well. 
Form 8843 must be filed if an individual is:    

present in the U.S. during the previous year,   
a non-resident alien, and   
present in the U.S. under F-1, F-2, J-1, or J-2 status. 

## Form W-2 
The IRS requires employers, like Baylor, to report wage and salary information for employees on Form W-2. 
Your W-2 also reports the amount of federal, state and other taxes withheld from your paycheck. 
Baylor is required to make the W-2 available no later than January 31st of each year. You may download 
it from Bearweb or you may go to the Payroll Office to pick-up a copy. If you worked for Baylor and did 
not receive a W-2, you should contact the Baylor Payroll Office at (254) 710-2217. If you worked for any 
other company and it has not been mailed to you, you should contact that company's payroll office. Some 
indiviudals who receive a W-2 may also receive a Form 1042-S (see below)

## Form 1042-S  
Form 1042-S is a special tax form for non-residents such as international students and scholars who are reporting 
income from a United States-based source, such as Baylor University. Baylor will mail you this form at the end of 
February or you may go to the Payroll Office to pick it up. You may receive a 1042-S Form if you are a graduate 
student who can claim a tax treaty and you worked for a department and received a stipend. You also might 
receive this form if you are an athlete who received a Baylor scholarship. Some individuals who receive a 1042-S 
may also receive a W-2.     

Please note – If you are from a treaty country and your earnings did not go over the treaty limit, 
you will only have a 1042-S form, and no W-2 form.  If your earnings did go over the treaty limit, 
you will have both a W-2 form and a 1042-S form.    

Baylor University has arranged free access to Sprintax Tax Preparation for you. Sprintax will guide you through the tax preparation process, arrange the necessary documents and check if you are due a tax refund.  Sprintax will include Form 8843 as part of your tax returns. 

If you are filing as a non-resident (meaning you have been in the U.S. less than 5 years), DO NOT use other services such as Turbo Tax or H&R Block.
Sprintax was used by over 165,000 international students and scholars last year, and the average Federal refund received by eligible students was over $1,087.
